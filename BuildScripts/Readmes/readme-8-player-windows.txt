TowerFall Version: 8-Player (tested on 1.3.2.0)
Platform: Windows

## How to patch the game

1. (Optional) Backup your TF-8P. The patcher will backup overwritten files, but 2 backups are
better than one.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to where you've unzipped the patcher
3. Run Wizard.exe with the path to the TF-8P you wish to patch. For example:

./Wizard.exe ~/Games/TF-8P

After patching, the original TowerFall.exe will be copied to TowerFall-Original.exe. If
you wish to restore the unpatched game you can simply replace the patched TowerFall.exe
with the original.
