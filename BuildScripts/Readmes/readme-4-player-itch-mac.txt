TowerFall Version: Itch (tested on 1.3.3.1)
Platform: Mac

## How to patch the game

1. (Optional) Backup your TowerFall.app. The patcher will backup overwritten files, but 2
backups are better than one.
2. Open terminal and navigate to where you've unzipped the patcher
3. Run the patch-tf command with the path to TowerFall.app. For example:

./patch-tf ~/Games/TowerFall.app

After patching, the original TowerFall.exe will be copied to TowerFall-Original.exe. If
you wish to restore the unpatched game you can simply replace the patched TowerFall.exe
with the original.
