TowerFall Version: Steam (tested on 1.3.3.3)
Platform: Mac

## How to patch the game

1. (Recommended) Make a copy of your TowerFall.app. This will be the version that you patch, leaving the original
untouched. If you prefer you could patch the Steam installation and use the "Verify integrity of game files" option
to restore to the unpatched version.
2. Open terminal and navigate to where you've unzipped the patcher
3. Run the patch-tf command with the path to TowerFall.app. For example:

./patch-tf ~/Games/TowerFall.app
