TowerFall Version: Steam (tested on 1.3.3.3)
Platform: Windows

## How to patch the game

1. (Optional) Backup your TowerFall folder. The patcher will backup overwritten files, but 2
backups are better than one.
2. Run Wizard.exe

Note: It seems that you have no option but to patch the game at its default install location. You can
provide Wizard.exe with a path, and it will patch the files at that location, but when you actually run that
copy of the game it appears to run the Steam version anyway.

After patching, the original TowerFall.exe will be copied to TowerFall-Original.exe. If
you wish to restore the unpatched game you can simply replace the patched TowerFall.exe
with the original.

Another option to restore is to use Steam's "Verify integrity of game files".
