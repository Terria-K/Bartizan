TowerFall Version: Steam (tested on 1.3.3.3)
Platform: Windows

## How to patch the game

1. (Optional) Backup your TowerFall folder so you don't have to redownload it to restore the original version.
You can skip this step and use Steam's "Verify integrity of game files" instead.
2. Run Wizard.exe

Note: It seems that you have no option but to patch the game at its default install location. You can
provide Wizard.exe with a path, and it will patch the files at that location, but when you actually run that
copy of the game it appears to run the Steam version anyway.
